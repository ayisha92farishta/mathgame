Ayisha: superclass is game, subclass is players, and another subclass is whose turn it is
Superclass has to limit the players to only two
And we may have to predetermine that the variables will be named either p1/p2 or "Player 1"/"Player 2"
depending on whether we will access them by their @name or by their variable name.

Start game
There needs to be a variable to determine whose turn it is, perhaps make a class
with a method that switches from p1 to p2 and back which gets called whenever
a question is answered.
Make two variables, each random integers from 1 to 20
puts first question with the two variables
if gets.chomp is the sum of the two, then p1.right_answer and switch players
else p1.wrong_answer and switch
After each question, check how many lives everyone has
and if somebody has 0 lives, then game over

Also have a class for question, create new one for every instance
Make a method that's like def answer(ans)
if ans == num1 + num2
then the answer is right
else it's wrong
(return right or wrong)
